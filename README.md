Offensive Security Kali Nethunter Port Project for Zenfone 5(T00F)

This project is WIP. You can find more information about Kali Nethunter below. Kernel is already built, and will be added to project when following requirements are met.

TODO:  
 -- Add exception to installer script for boot image building for T00F as it has a different tool for boot image compression.  
 -- Add boot partition path to devices.cfg (Too lazy to check device :P)  

# NetHunter - Mobile Penetration Testing Platform
![Kali NetHunter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/offensive-security/kali-nethunter/master/images/nethunter-git-logo.png)
## A project by Offensive Security
**The Kali NetHunter** is an Android penetration testing platform targeted towards Nexus and OnePlus devices built on top of Kali Linux, which includes some special and unique features. 
Of course, you have all the usual Kali tools in NetHunter as well as the ability to get a full VNC session from your phone to a graphical Kali chroot, however the strength of NetHunter does not end there. 
We've incorporated some amazing features into the NetHunter OS which are both powerful and unique. From pre-programmed HID Keyboard (Teensy) attacks, to BadUSB Man In The Middle attacks, to one-click MANA Evil Access Point setups, access to the Offensive Security Exploit Database... 
And yes, NetHunter natively supports wireless 802.11 frame injection with a variety of supported USB NICs.

## Documentation and Attack Descriptions
Attack descriptions as well as some documentation to get you started with the installation and setup of Kali NetHunter can be found at https://github.com/offensive-security/kali-nethunter/wiki.

## Is Kali NetHunter an Android ROM?

Kali Linux NetHunter is **not** a ROM but is meant to be installed over an existing stock/factory image of Android. It can also be installed over some Cyanogenmod based ROMs depending on device support. It is heavily based on using custom kernels and only supports a select number of devices.
We're relying on you, the community, to port your devices for the full Kali NetHunter experience.
